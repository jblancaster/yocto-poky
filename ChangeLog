    * classes/package_rpm: fix bitbake package-index for RPM

    * http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/commit/?id=2f64fae60b3f61a2c45dc9e5314d2d16b1e64605

    * The function that "bitbake package-index" relies upon when using the RPM
      package backend (package_update_index_rpm()) uses MULTILIB_PREFIX_LIST
      to get the list of package architectures to be indexed, but that
      variable is only set when populate_sdk_rpm or rootfs_rpm are inherited,
      which is not the case for the package-index recipe. Until we're able to
      refactor this properly, for minimal impact just use the value of
      ALL_MULTILIB_PACKAGE_ARCHS if MULTILIB_PREFIX_LIST does not give us any
      architectures (the equivalent function in the ipk backend uses the
      former variable).

      Having "bitbake package-index" working is important because it's the
      only practical way of indexing RPM packages for use as a feed; host
      versions of createrepo won't work properly because they won't support
      indexing recommends relationships.

      Stopgap fix for [YOCTO #5278].
